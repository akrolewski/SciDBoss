Description of files:

SciDB:
login_instructions: describes how to log into scidb
load_boss_test_sample: commands for loading the test sample

main_scidb.py: runs 1 iteration of the continuum-fitting script, using SciDB.  folows the procedure described in documentation.pdf

main_scidb4_timing.rtf: describes the time it takes for the scidb script to reach different milestones in the script.
Scaling_Test.xlsx: scaling test for the scidb and python scripts
scaling_test.rtf: describes the outcome of the scaling tests

Python:
boss_test_sample.fits: fits file describing the 5000 quasars in the test sample.  This is a portion of the DR12 catalog.
boss_test_sample: the 5000 quasar spectra

main.py: runs the continuum-fitting script using python. follows the procedure described in documentation.pdf
lya_functions.py: called by main.py for the python continuum-fitting.
find_fz.py: called by main.py for the python continuum-fitting.
mean_continuum.py: called by main.py for the python continuum-fitting.

run2: contains plots and data figures from the execution of main.py.
the final figures are continuum_3.pdf and fz_3.pdf.  the "quasars" folder
contains plots of the fit from each quasar, sorted by chisq.

Documentation:
documentation.pdf: describes the continuum fitting procedure
